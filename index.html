                        Inspired by American football and the concept of 'Symbiosis'. With these in mind, FURIA was
                        born.
                        What
                        does it suggest? ‘Life is furiouss, sexual, magic, brutal, it pushes us to our noblest heights
                        and
                        our
                        lowest depths. From fury comes creation, inspiration, originality and passion. But also,
                        violence,
                        pain,
                        pure destruction without fear of reprisals. FURIA is a brand that creates collections with
                        dyscruptive
                        concepts. A synonym for strength and design. FURIA chases us, and the fierce dance to create.

                        Inspired by different existing 'containers', materialized in cowhide and cotton wool. The
                        inspiration behind this particular collection was 'entanglement', not in the literal sense of
                        the
                        word, but of the deeper meaning behind it.
                        Entrañamiento means to include, contain or imply, entail, or enter the deepest parts of the
                        soul,
                        intimately join two or more people. It is also joining, indulging wholeheartedly with someone or
                        something.

                        reinvents situations and suburban landscapes with new digital technologies. Almost all the
                        architecture on which he worked, was demolished. The concept I used to design was ‘create

                        morphologies of the Dionisio’s buildings, and design new ones with the help of heat to shape it

                        with
                        its gray, static and geometric structures and buildings. In its desolate and quiet neighborhood

                        in constant movement. What is immobility? Is it static? I descended to physical and moral
                        immobility, and the brain was brought to me. It is forbidden to learn to work and for the first
                        time, I feel that every movement tends to immobility.

                        Inspired by Juan Manuel Fangio, who was an Argentinian speed motorist. The concept behind these
                        garments was swiftness. ‘I think that living fast is not living, it is surviving. Our culture
                        instills in us, the fear of wasting time, but the paradox is that acceleration makes us waste
                        life’.
                        Today everyone suffers from the disease of time, the obsessive belief that time is moving away
                        and
                        you must pedal faster and faster.

                        that sought to fulfill the needs of an everyday life, and several layers was used to protect
